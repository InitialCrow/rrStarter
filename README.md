rrStarter v3.0
===================


Hi you can use this litle script for init bootstrap your redux-react project watchout, this is not a framework but a 'classic base of redux project' with this script you can choose to init your project from scratch or if you use ES6 with babel, react, redux, express with nodejs, you will init all your project and install dependencies you have a webpack-config with this.

----------


HOW TO USE
-------------

Just run `sh install.sh`in your teminal after script ask you if you want to choose install with framework or from scratch

- After dependencies was installed add this lines to **package.json** (you can add other script if you need)
`   "start"        : "npm-run-all --parallel watch:server watch:build",
    "watch:build"  : "webpack --config ./webpack.dev.js --watch",
    "watch:server" : "nodemon \"./dist/server.js\" --watch \"./dist\"",
    "build:dev"    : "webpack --config ./webpack.dev.js",
    "build:prod"   : "webpack --config ./webpack.prod.js"
`

now you are ready to dev with nodejs react and redux fast no ?

- Just run `npm start` this will create a **dist** folder with webpack and nodemon watching

or

- you can run `build:prod` to create production build in **dist** after you just need to upload dist folder on production service you can sett your env variable in **.env** file
